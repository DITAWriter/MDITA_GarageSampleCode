# Spray painting

When paint is applied using a spray nozzle, it is referred to as spray painting.

The garage is a good place to spray paint.

1. Move the car out of the garage to avoid getting paint on it.
2. Place newspaper, cardboard, or a drop-cloth on the garage floor.
3. Place the object to be painted on the covered area.
4. Follow the directions on the paint can to paint the object.
5. Let the paint dry thoroughly before you move the object.
