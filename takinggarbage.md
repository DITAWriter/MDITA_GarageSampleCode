# Taking out the garbage

Regular garbage removal is necessary for the proper functioning of a home.

Your municipality collects garbage from homes once a week, usually early in the morning.

1. Find out from the town what day of the week garbage is collected in your neighborhood.
2. The night before collection, place the garbage cans on the curb.
3. After the garbage has been collected, move the cans back into your garage.
