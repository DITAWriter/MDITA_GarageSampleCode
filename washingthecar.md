# Washing the car

Keep your car looking great by washing it regularly.

1. Move the car onto the driveway.
2. Attach the water hose to a spout and pull the free end over to the car.
3. Fill a bucket with soapy water.
4. Use a sponge to apply the soapy water to the car and scrub off the dirt.
5. Rinse the car by spraying clean water from the hose.
6. Dry the car using a dampened chamois.
