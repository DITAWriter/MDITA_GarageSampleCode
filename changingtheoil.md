Once every 6000 kilometers or three months, change the oil in your car.

Changing the oil regularly will help keep the engine in good condition.

To change the oil:

1. Remove the old oil filter.
2. Drain the old oil.
3. Install a new oil filter and gasket.
4. Add new oil to the engine.
5. Check the air filter and replace or clean it.
6. Top up the windshield washer fluid.
